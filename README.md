## Chess

This is a program for playing chess. In its current form, it is very basic, but
it has an intuitive GUI for ease of play.

### How to use

Download the repository. Install Python 3 if you do not have it. You will also
need to install the `PyQt5` and `numpy` packages. You can install them will the following
commands:

```bash
pip install --user PyQt5
pip install --user numpy
```

Note that depending on your system, the command may be `pip` or `pip3` for
Python 3. Refer to your system's manual. **NOTE: This project currently runs on
Python 3.9, though we will probably tweak it to work with older versions later**

To run the program:

```bash
python src/app_main.py
```

from the root of the repository, though it should work from any relative path.
